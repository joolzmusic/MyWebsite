# MyWebsite
MyWebsite for CMPT276

Overview of the project:

I've created a personal website to showcase my identity and skills. The site is a blend of my passion for music, particularly piano, and my journey as a frontend developer. When you visit, you'll find a homepage introducing me, a detailed 'About Me' section, and areas dedicated to both my musical and coding projects. The services I offer, ranging from performances to web development, are highlighted, and there's a convenient contact section for inquiries. I've used a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure and style the content, and Boxicons for some aesthetic icons. Additionally, GitHub Pages serves as the hosting platform for my site, making it accessible to everyone. It's been an exciting project, allowing me to combine my artistic and technical sides into a digital space that reflects who I am.
